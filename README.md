## Getting Up and Running Locally

### Requirements

Make sure to have the following on your host:

- Python
- Django
- Postgres
- Celery
- Redis

### Setting Up Development Environment with Python

1. **Clone the repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/abdurrahimcs50/Django-Boilerplate-Project.git
    ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment**: It‚Äôs a good practice to create a virtual environment for your project to isolate your project‚Äôs dependencies.

    ```bash
    # Create a virtualenv:
    python -m venv venv
    # Activate the virtualenv you have just created:
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install development requirements**: Install the project dependencies from the requirements.txt file.

    ```bash
    cd Django-Boilerplate-Project
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Set up environment variables**: Copy the .env.example file to a new file called .env, and fill in your actual values.

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env

    # Example .env

    SECRET_KEY=changeme
    ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost 127.0.0.1
    DEBUG=1
    CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS=https://*.example.com https://*.192.162.0.0.1

    ENGINE=django.db.backends.postgresql
    POSTGRES_DB=changeme
    POSTGRES_PASSWORD=changeme
    POSTGRES_USER=changeme
    POSTGRES_HOST=changeme
    POSTGRES_PORT=changeme
    ```

5. **Run migrations**: Django uses a database-abstraction API that lets you create, retrieve, update, and delete records.

    ```bash
    python manage.py makemigrations
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

6. **Start the server**: You can start the server using the Django‚Äôs built-in server for development.

    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

### Now, you can visit http://localhost:8000 in your web browser to see your application.

# Build the Stack On Local and Production Development Using Docker and Docker Compose.

1. **Build the Docker images:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose -f local_dev.yml build
    ```

    For production:
    ```bash
    docker-compose -f production.yml build
    ```

2. **Run the Docker containers:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose -f local_dev.yml up

    # For detached (background) mode, use:
    docker-compose -f local_dev.yml up -d
    ```

    For production:
    ```bash
    docker-compose -f production.yml up

    # For detached (background) mode, use:
    docker-compose -f production.yml up -d
    ```

    Visit http://localhost:8000 in your web browser for local development or http://localhost or http://127.0.0.1 for production.

3. ### Important Note:
    - In the context of executing commands, the term `web` refers to the target service. Please be aware that using `docker exec` is not suitable for running management commands in this scenario.

## Execute Management Commands

```bash
# Use the following commands to manage your Django application within the Docker container:

# For local development:
docker-compose -f local_dev.yml run --rm web python manage.py makemigrations
docker-compose -f local_dev.yml run --rm web python manage.py migrate
docker-compose -f local_dev.yml run --rm web python manage.py collectstatic
docker-compose -f local_dev.yml run --rm web python manage.py createsuperuser
docker-compose -f local_dev.yml run --rm web python manage.py startapp app_name
docker-compose -f local_dev.yml run --rm web python manage.py shell

# For production:
docker-compose -f production.yml run --rm web python manage.py makemigrations
docker-compose -f production.yml run --rm web python manage.py migrate
docker-compose -f production.yml run --rm web python manage.py collectstatic
docker-compose -f production.yml run --rm web python manage.py createsuperuser
docker-compose -f production.yml run --rm web python manage.py startapp app_name
docker-compose -f production.yml run --rm web python manage.py shell

## Running Tests

To run the tests for your Django application, you can use the following command within the Docker container:

### For local development:

```bash
docker-compose -f local_dev.yml run --rm web python manage.py test
```

### For production:

```bash
docker-compose -f production.yml run --rm web python manage.py test

```

This command will execute all the tests in your project, providing feedback on the success or failure of each test case.

**Note:** It's recommended to write tests for your Django application to ensure its stability and reliability. You can create test files in the `tests` directory of your Django app or follow [Django's testing documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/testing/) for more information: Django Testing Documentation.
